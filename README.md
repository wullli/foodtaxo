# FoodTaxo: Generating Food Taxonomies with Large Language Models

![alt text](assets/bootstrapping.auto.svg)

## Abstract
We investigate the utility of Large Language Models  for  automated  taxonomy  generation and  completion  specifically  applied  to  tax- onomies from the food technology industry. We explore the extent to which taxonomies can be completed from a seed taxonomy or generated without a seed from a set of known concepts, in an iterative fashion using recent prompting techniques.  Experiments on five taxonomies using an open-source LLM (Llama-3), while promising, point to the difficulty of correctly placing inner nodes.
